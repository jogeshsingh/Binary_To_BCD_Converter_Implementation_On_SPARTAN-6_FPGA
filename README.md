# Binary_To_BCD_Converter_Implementation_On_SPARTAN-6_FPGA
This project is based upon converting 8 bit binary data into Hexadecimal (BCD ) representation , as it is mostly used when data from outward source/inward source has to be provided to the receiver end , so it becomes necessary to read data efficiently when it is in BCD form rather than in Binary representation . This project was done in XILINX ISE 14.7 and Verilog HDL and XILINX SPARTAN-6 XC6SLX9 Mimas V2 FPGA Board was used
